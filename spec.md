Functional requirements for: Hub

All right so this is what a series of notes I'm gonna leave for the design implantation of a knowledge hub basically this is gonna be where we aggregate our separate data where we aggregate everything that's going on that we can think of and then make it available to large language models and other applications that might want to query it. so in concept it It's hybrid data set that contains vector versions vector encoded information and key value encoding and it will take as input things like exports from ChatGPT mail messages instant messages could be open conversations it could be telephone messages telephone conversations court hearings could be text from publications from documents Legal documents owners manuals that's the wide gambit is multi mod could have a images, video, audio.  and so ultimately all these things will land there and need to have a hybrid search capability we're doing similarity  searches with with vector database we're doing range searches and things like just for this user,  all users content, things that happened last Tuesday etc. so that's the introduction to this concept. 

Another source of data could be data feeds so we might have stock market information we might have real estate listings might have newsfeeds and so on. And then given that they'll be these ongoing feeds which may be large we want to in some instances to have storage of all the data which is permanent we have it for forever Other ones will want to summarize and expire older data or maintain references to things we can get on demand maybe even have Reed through cashing of things we can get on demand. We will also have instances with the user can upload data if they're doing some work with user interface they might want to say here's a document you don't have and let's incorporated into the status of either temporarily or permanently just like ChatGPT. And we have data that's auxiliary to other information so for example attachments to an email message Auxiliary to the email message proper and so they'll need to be detected and extracted and related back to their origin which would be the email message. And adding onto the state of feed idea one thing will be scanning data fee so there may be a fee coming out of news and it's not getting entirely it's not being stored entirely but we're watching for keywords key phrases key types of stories and then those are being extracted and put into our data set. And associated to that we have a push notification types of things where as data is being adjusted there are some triggers that would say I need to notify someone about that thing we were waiting for is done or whatever kind of triggers we can put on things that may kick off an agent to go do some work somewhere else things like that. 

Want to have a robust de duplicating capability. the last thing we want us to have documents multiple times in the data set. so we want to be able to detect these documents are the same they're almost the same and want to detect versions. so I want to know that the document that came in is an older version of a document we already have and then have some way to represent that in the dataset that here's the current version of that document here are the older ones. Say where we got the older one from, when we got the older one when the old one was made etc. so wanna de duplication and version detection capability and of course that we expose to the user in the manner where they upload a document and it will say hey this is a newer version of what we already have should we save it as such or it'll even say this is an older version there's a new version available would you like to see that one. 

So from an architecture standpoint that we're gonna assume commonly used API's of the things we're gonna use so we can use things like a quadrant affect database or use LLM that's open eye compatible use open the PI and MCP type services so let's assume those are the tools are the building blocks that we have to use rather and we wanna build it the way that it could be self hosted All this will mostly run on the self installation but also we may be leveraging things from open AI and so as information comes into the system some of it make it sort up there it might be a duplicated might be the unique source of it we will incorporate other models from the cloud and our only local models it's in some cases we want the best of Other resources. 

I want to have clients to access the data both for managing it entering data and probably most of the time would be clearing the data and so we want a robust web interface that could work on mobile and maybe even a native mobile app and native desktop app for macOS And then we will want it to expose commonly used API as well so that our own data stores hub will expose AI compatible and points for chat completions for query file systems etc. etc. so we can have other applications use it and specifically will want to implement the connectors PI from open AI so we can have a custom GPT talked through a connector will want to people have an assistant to function calling on they think they call actions and then just generally will want to be able to instruct models to use it as a function calling and point and so employing all the apis for that. 

And then they'll be a Sweet of tools to manage the system so we want to link into our Griff on Prometheus monitoring system and we could put our monitoring alert so we'll need health checks on each system and I'll have to produce some statistics on their operation and then we need an admin interface on each system to diagnose issues and Manage settings there as well as you command lines as well but we need a set of tools for administering the system and walk back up capabilities and things like that built into our deliverable
